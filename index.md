# Introduction

Here's a short video outlinging what Benchmarking looks like with Juju

OMG VIDEO  

## Deploy a workload

We'll deploy an example workload to run benchmarks against. For an exhaustive
list of all benchmarks available please see the [All Benchmarks]() section.

```
juju deploy mediawiki
juju deploy mariadb
juju add-relation mariadb mediawiki:db
```

## Add a load generator

Since this is a typical three tier web infrastructure, we'll add [siege]() to
create load over HTTP

```
juju deploy siege
juju add-relation mediawiki siege
```

## Run a benchmark

Either visit the benchmark-gui address or issue the following command

```
juju action do siege/0 siege concurrent=30
Action queued with: c3dfec96-8efe-11e5-932d-17d2f80bf113
```

### Get results!

```
juju action fetch c3dfec96-8efe-11e5-932d-17d2f80bf113
results:
  meta:
    composite:
      direction: desc
      units: ops/sec
      value: "106331"
    raw: |
      Sleeping 2s...
      Warming up WRITE with 50000 iterations...
      Running WRITE with 200 threads for 1000000 iteration

      [SNIP. Raw output from the load generator]

```

Repeat, rerun, record!

## Benchmark infrastructure

Finally, we add some additional supporting infrastructure to allow metrics and
benchmark data to be collected as well as providing an easy to use GUI

```
juju deploy benchmark-gui
juju deploy benchmark-collector
juju add-relation benchmark-gui seige
juju add-relation benchmark-collector siege
juju add-relation benchmark-collector mediawiki
juju add-relation benchmark-collector mariadb
juju add-relation benchmark-collector benchmark-gui
```
